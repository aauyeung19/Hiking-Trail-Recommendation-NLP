# Metis-Project-4

## Objective:
In this time of social distancing, people are looking for different and new ways of safely getting outdoors.  The AllTrails app is a great way to find new trails and paths near you.  I never leave home on a trip without planning ahead to know what trail lies ahead.  In this project, I aimed to generate recommendations for my next adventure using trail descriptions and reviews offered on the platform.
